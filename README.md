the website uses html, css, js and php with RDBMS connectivity to store user data and allow them to extract their information from anywhere anytime. InsightMed has a simple interactive User Interface for ease of use. The chatbot is designed to have capabililty to answer health related questions.
Patients can see hospitals nearby them by entering their current location. 
User can store their health history where options such as disease, doctor name, prescription given, etc.  are all included. Anytime a user becomes sick, he can immediately check his/her health history and temporarily treat himself/herself until a doctor is available.

This project can be elaborated by adding extra features like local spped recognition in health history, involvement of doctor and their seperate registration, enhanced security, suggestion of appropriate doctors nearby the current location.
